# Plant Phenotyping with limited aan
This repository contains the code used to run the deep active learning experiments detailed in our paper "Plant Phenotyping with Limited Annotation: Doing More with Less"
## Dependencies
In order to run our code, you'll need these main packages:

- [Python>=3.5](https://www.python.org/)
- [solo-learn>=1.03]([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn))
- [Pytorch>=1.9](https://pytorch.org/)

[Models_and_hyperparameters.zip](https://iastate.box.com/s/hxf20a31ucnr4drsum1f3qoe2p7g6ecr)

## Running the code
We used the SSL implementations and linear classification codes from [solo-learn]([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://github.com/vturrisi/solo-learn) for this work. 
We used the codes [pytorch vision references](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification) for the end-to-end fine-tuning.
